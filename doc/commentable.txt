3.2 MAPPINGS                                           *commentable-mappings*
------------

Commentable does not provide any default mappings - it doesn't want to wreck
your carefully crafted custom shortcuts. It does, however, provide a set of
<Plug> mappings which call equivalents from the |commentable-commands|
sections, and also integrates with Tim Pope's |vim-repeat| plugin, setting the
'.' key to repeat the mapped-to action.

The mappings are defined in `Normal-mode`, `Visual-mode`, and `Select-mode`.
In Normal mode they call the corresponding command on the current line; in
Visual and Select mode they call the command with the current selection as the
range.

In order to use these mappings you will need to map something on to them in
your `vimrc` file. An example of how you might do this is: >
      :nmap ,c <Plug>(CommentableReformat)
      :vmap ,c <Plug>(CommentableReformat)
      :nmap ,C <Plug>(CommentableCreate)
      :vmap ,C <Plug>(CommentableCreate)
In order for this to work the standard `:map` set of commands must be used
rather then usually preferred `:noremap` set.

<Plug>(CommentableCreate)                         *<Plug>(CommentableCreate)*
                        Carries out the same action as
                        |:CommentableCreate| - i.e. creates a new block
                        comment with the current line as its contents. Also
                        sets the '`.`' key to repeat this if |vim-repeat| is
                        installed.

<Plug>(CommentableReformat)                     *<Plug>(CommentableReformat)*
                        Carries out the same action as
                        |:CommentableReformat| - i.e. reformats the block
                        under the cursor according to the current
                        configuration. Also sets the '`.`' key to repeat this
                        if |vim-repeat| is installed.
