1. ABOUT COMMENTABLE ~
                                                          *commentable-about*

Commentable provides expanded comment block handling for Vim, specifically
for comments with "walls" - right-aligned closing boundaries and marker
lines above and below the block. It has many different configuration
variables, allowing you to set the block generation and formatting to your
preferred style for each filetype or project.

Commentable's homepage is its github repository:
https://www.github.com/galtish/vim-commentable.git

1.1 REQUIREMENTS                                   *commentable-requirements*
----------------

Commentable requires Vim version 7.4 or later, and only loads if the
'compatible' option is not set. It does not require Vim to be compiled with
any particular plugin language support - but obviously requires the |+eval|
feature.

3. COMMANDS AND MAPPINGS ~
                                                        *commentable-exposed*

3.1 COMMANDS                                           *commentable-commands*
------------

:CommentableCreate                                       *:CommentableCreate*

:CommentableReformat                                   *:CommentableReformat*

:CommentableSetDefaultBindings               *:CommentableSetDefaultBindings*

:CommentableSetDefaultStyle                     *:CommentableSetDefaultStyle*

3.2 MAPPINGS                                           *commentable-mappings*
------------

Commentable does not provide any default mappings - it doesn't want to wreck
your carefully crafted custom shortcuts. It does, however, provide a set of
<Plug> mappings which call equivalents from the |commentable-commands|
sections, and also integrates with Tim Pope's |vim-repeat| plugin, setting the
'.' key to repeat the mapped-to action.

The mappings are defined in `Normal-mode`, `Visual-mode`, and `Select-mode`.
In Normal mode they call the corresponding command on the current line; in
Visual and Select mode they call the command with the current selection as
the range.

In order to use these mappings you will need to map something on to them in
your `vimrc` file. An example of how you might do this is: >
      :nmap ,c <Plug>(CommentableReformat)
      :vmap ,c <Plug>(CommentableReformat)
      :nmap ,C <Plug>(CommentableCreate)
      :vmap ,C <Plug>(CommentableCreate)
In order for this to work the standard `:map` set of commands must be used
rather then usually preferred `:noremap` set.

<Plug>(CommentableCreate)                         *<Plug>(CommentableCreate)*
                        Carries out the same action as
                        |:CommentableCreate| - i.e. creates a new block
                        comment with the current line as its contents. Also
                        sets the '`.`' key to repeat this if |vim-repeat| is
                        installed.

<Plug>(CommentableReformat)                     *<Plug>(CommentableReformat)*
                        Carries out the same action as
                        |:CommentableReformat| - i.e. reformats the block
                        under the cursor according to the current
                        configuration. Also sets the '`.`' key to repeat this
                        if |vim-repeat| is installed.
